Overview

KO-CAP EIN

The KEMET Organic Capacitors (KO-CAP) are preferred solutions for applications requiring power loss protection (hold-up) or maximum power efficiency of a circuit when board space is limited. Desired benefits include high energy density, stable capacitance with applied voltage and temperature, and no aging effects. The conductive polymer cathode of these solid electrolytic capacitors

provide very low ESR and higher capacitance retention at high frequencies. Unlike liquid electrolyte-based capacitors, KEMET polymer capacitors have a very long operational life and high ripple current capabilities. Capacitors from T520, T521, and T523 series are commonly used in these applications. The T545 and T548 were introduced to meet specific needs for a subsegment of solid state drives.

Benefits

Highest energy per unit volume • Stable capacitance across temperature and voltage • No aging effects • Low ESR values • High frequency capacitance retention • High ripple handling • 100% accelerated steady state aging • 100% surge current tested • Halogen-free epoxy and RoHS compliant

Applications

Typical applications include enterprise storage, networking, server, mobile, client storage, and client computing.

Reliability

KO-CAP capacitors have an average failure rate of 0.5 %/1,000 hours at category voltage, UC, and category temperature, TC. These capacitors are qualified using industry test standards at UC and TC. The minimum test time (1,000 hours or 2,000 hours) is dependent on the product.

The actual life expectancy of KO-CAP capacitors increases when application voltage, UA, and application temperature, TA, are lower than UC and TC. As a general guideline, when UA < 0.9 * UC and TA < 85°C, the life expectancy will typically exceed the useful lifetime of most hardware (> 10 years).

The lifetime of a KO-CAP capacitor at a specific application voltage and temperature can be modeled using the equations below. A failure is defined as passing enough current to blow a 1-amp fuse. The calculation is an estimation based on empirical results and is not a guarantee.

VAF = ( )UC  UA  n  where:  VAF = acceleration factor due to voltage, unitless  UC = category voltage, volt UA = application voltage, volt n = exponent, 16 

TAF = e  [ (  Ea k  1  273+TA  1  273+TC  )]  where: TAF = acceleration factor due to temperature, unitless Ea = activation energy, 1.4 eV k = Boltzmann’s constant, 8.617E-5 eV/K TA = application temperature, °C TC = category temperature, °C 

AF = VAF * TAF   where:  AF = acceleration factor, unitless  TAF = accerlation factor due to temperature, unitless  VAF = acceleration factor due to voltage, unitless

Terms: Category voltage, UC : maximum recommended peak DC operating voltage for continuous operation at the category temperature, TC Rated voltage, UR : maximum recommended peak DC operating voltage for continuous operation up to the rated temperature, TR Category temperature, TC : maximum recommended operating temperature.

Recommended Application Voltage KO-CAPs are solid state capacitors that demonstrate no wearout mechanism when operated within their recommended guidelines. While the KO-CAP can be operated at full rated voltage, most circuit designers seek a minimum level of assurance in long term reliability, which should be demonstrated with data. A voltage derating can provide the desired level of demonstrated reliability based on industry accepted acceleration models. Since most applications do require long term reliability, KEMET recommends that designers consider a 10% voltage derating, according to the graphic above, for the maximum steady state voltage.

Ripple Current/Ripple Voltage

Permissible AC ripple voltage and current are related to equivalent series resistance (ESR) and the power dissipation capabilities of the device.

Permissible AC ripple voltage which may be applied is limited by two criteria: a. The positive peak AC voltage plus the DC bias voltage, if any, must not exceed the DC voltage rating of the capacitor. b. The negative peak AC voltage, in combination with bias voltage, if any, must not exceed the allowable limits specified for reverse voltage.

The maximum power dissipation by case size can be determined using the below table.

Temperature Compensation Multipliers for Maximum Ripple Current 45° C < T ≤ 85°C T ≤ 45°C 85°C < T ≤ 125°C 1.00 0.70 0.25

T = Environmental temperature

Using the P max of the device, the maximum allowable rms ripple current or voltage may be determined.

I(max) = √P max/R E(max) = Z √P max/R

I = rms ripple current (amperes) E = rms ripple voltage (volts) P max = maximum power dissipation(watts) R = ESR at specified frequency (ohms) Z = Impedance at specified frequency (Ohms)

Refer to part number listings for permittable Arms limits.

Surge Voltage

Surge voltage is the maximum voltage (peak value) which may be applied to the capacitor. The surge voltage must not be applied for periodic charging and discharging in the course of normal operation and cannot be part of the application voltage. Surge voltage capability is demonstrated by application of 1,000 cycles at operating temperature. The parts are charged through a 33 Ohm resistor for 30 seconds and then discharged though a 33 Ohm resistor for each cycle.

Soldering Process

The KEMET families of surface mount capacitors are compatible with wave (single or dual), convection, IR, or vapor phase reflow techniques. Preheating of these components is recommended to avoid extreme thermal stress. KEMET's recommended profile conditions for convection and IR reflow reflect the profile conditions of the IPC/J–STD–020D standard for moisture sensitivity testing. The devices can safely withstand a maximum of three reflow passes at these conditions.

Please note that although the X/7343–43 and O/7360-43 case size can withstand wave soldering, the tall profile (4.3 mm maximum) dictates care in wave process development.

Profile Feature Preheat/Soak Temperature Minimum (TSmin) Temperature Maximum (TSmax) Time (ts) from Tsmin to Tsmax) Ramp-up Rate (TL to TP) Liquidous Temperature (TL) Time Above Liquidous (tL) Peak Temperature (TP) Time within 5°C of Maximum Peak Temperature (tP) Ramp-down Rate (TP to TL) Time 25°C to Peak Temperature Pb-Free Assembly 150°C 200°C 60 – 120 seconds 3°C/second maximum 217°C 60 – 150 seconds 250°C* 260°C** 30 seconds maximum 6°C/second maximum 8 minutes maximum

Hand soldering should be performed with care due to the difficulty in process control. If performed, care should be taken to avoid contact of the soldering iron to the molded case. The iron should be used to heat the solder pad, applying solder between the pad and the termination, until reflow occurs. Once reflow occurs, the iron should be removed immediately. “Wiping” the edges of a chip and heating the top surface is not recommended.

Note: All temperatures refer to the center of the package, measured on the package body surface that is facing up during assembly reflow. * For Case Size height > 2.5 mm ** For Case Size height ≤ 2.5 mm

Storage

All KO-Cap are shipped in moisture barrier bags (MBBs) with desiccant and humidity indicator card (HIC). These parts are classified as moisture sensitivity level 3 (MSL3) or moisture sensitivity level 4 (MSL4) per IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020 and packaged per IPC/JEDEC J–STD–033. Refer to Table 1 for part type specification. MSL3 specifies a floor time of 168H at 30°C maximum temperature and 60% relative humidity. MSL4 specifies a floor time of 72H at 30°C maximum temperature and 60% relative humidity. Unused capacitors should be sealed in a MBB with fresh desiccant.

Calculated shelf life in sealed bag: – 12 months from bag seal date in a storage environment of < 40°C and humidity < 90% RH – 24 months from bag seal date in a storage environment of < 30°C and humidity < 70% RH

If baking is required, refer to IPC/JEDEC J–STD–033 for bake procedure
