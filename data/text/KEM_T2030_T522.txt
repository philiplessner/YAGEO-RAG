KEMET Organic Capacitor (KO-CAP®) – Industrial T522 Reduced Leakage Polymer Electrolytic, 6.3 VDC

KEMET aYAGEO company

Overview

KO-CAP EIN

The KEMET Organic Capacitor (KO-CAP) is a solid electrolytic capacitor with a conductive polymer cathode capable of delivering very low ESR and improved capacitance retention at high frequencies. KO-CAP combines the low ESR of multilayer ceramic, the high capacitance of aluminum electrolytic, and the volumetric efficiency of tantalum into a single surface mount package. Unlike liquid electrolyte-based capacitors, KO-CAP has a very long operational life, and high ripple current capabilities.

—_

The T522 Reduced Leakage Polymer Electrolytic design is based on the T520 KO-CAP series. Developed specifically to meet the needs of leakage current sensitive applications, the T522 is well-suited for battery-based circuits. The T522 provides the lowest leakage values available in polymer electrolytic capacitors, with upper leakage limits that are up to 70% lower than comparable KO-CAP capacitors.

Reliability

KO-CAP capacitors have an average failure rate of 0.5 %/1,000 hours at category voltage, UC, and category temperature, TC. These capacitors are qualified using industry test standards at UC and TC. The minimum test time (1,000 or 2,000 hours) is dependent on the product.

The actual life expectancy of KO-CAP capacitors increases when application voltage, UA, and application temperature, TA, are lower than UC and TC. As a general guideline, when UA < 0.9 * UC and TA < 85°C, the life expectancy will typically exceed the useful lifetime of most hardware (> 10 years).

The lifetime of a KO-CAP capacitor at a specific application voltage and temperature can be modeled using the equations below. A failure is defined as passing enough current to blow a 1-Amp fuse. The calculation is an estimation based on empirical results and is not a guarantee.

Recommended Application Voltage KO-CAPs are solid state capacitors that demonstrate no wearout mechanism when operated within their recommended guidelines. While the KO-CAP can be operated at full rated voltage, most circuit designers seek a minimum level of assurance in long term reliability, which should be demonstrated with data. A voltage derating can provide the desired level of demonstrated reliability based on industry accepted acceleration models. Since most applications do require long term reliability, KEMET recommends that designers consider a voltage derating, according the graphic above, for the maximum steady state voltage

Ripple Current/Ripple Voltage

Permissible AC ripple voltage and current are related to equivalent series resistance (ESR) and the power dissipation capabilities of the device. Permissible AC ripple voltage which may be applied is limited by two criteria: 1. The positive peak AC voltage plus the DC bias voltage,

if any, must not exceed the DC voltage rating of the capacitor.

2. The negative peak AC voltage in combination with bias voltage, if any, must not exceed the allowable limits specified for reverse voltage. See the Reverse Voltage section for allowable limits.

The maximum power dissipation by case size can be determined using the table at right. The maximum power dissipation rating stated in the table must be reduced with increasing environmental operating temperatures. Refer to the table below for temperature compensation requirements.

Temperature Compensation Multipliers for Maximum Ripple Current 45° C < T ≤ 85°C T ≤ 45°C 85°C < T ≤ 125°C 1.00 0.70 0.25

Surge Voltage

Surge voltage is the maximum voltage (peak value) which may be applied to the capacitor. The surge voltage must not be applied for periodic charging and discharging in the course of normal operation and cannot be part of the application voltage. Surge voltage capability is demonstrated by application of 1,000cycles at relevant voltage at 105ºC and 125ºC. The parts are charged through a 33 Ohm resistor for 30 seconds and then discharged though a 33 Ohm resistor for each cycle.

Soldering Process

KEMET’s families of surface mount capacitors are compatible with wave (single or dual), convection, IR, or vapor phase reflow techniques. Preheating of these components is recommended to avoid extreme thermal stress. KEMET's recommended profile conditions for convection and IR reflow reflect the profile conditions of the IPC/J–STD–020D standard for moisture sensitivity testing. The devices can safely withstand a maximum of three reflow passes at these conditions.

Please note that although the X/7343–43 case size can withstand wave soldering, the tall profile (4.3 mm maximum) dictates care in wave process development.

Hand soldering should be performed with care due to the difficulty in process control. If performed, care should be taken to avoid contact of the soldering iron to the molded case. The iron should be used to heat the solder pad, applying solder between the pad and the termination, until reflow occurs. Once reflow occurs, the iron should be removed immediately. “Wiping” the edges of a chip and heating the top surface is not recommended.

Note: All temperatures refer to the center of the package, measured on the package body surface that is facing up during assembly reflow. * For Case Size height > 2.5 mm ** For Case Size height ≤ 2.5 mm

Storage

All KO-CAP Series are shipped in moisture barrier bags (MBBs) with desiccant and humidity indicator card (HIC). These parts are classified as MSL3 (Moisture Sensitivity Level 3) per IPC/JEDEC J–STD–020 and packaged per IPC/JEDEC J–STD–033. MSL3 specifies a floor time of 168H at 30°C maximum temperature and 60% relative humidity. Unused capacitors should be sealed in a MBB with fresh desiccant.

The calculated shelf life in a sealed bag would be 12 months from a bag seal date in a storage environment of < 40°C and humidity < 90% RH. It should be 24 months from a bag seal date in a storage environment of < 30°C and humidity < 70% RH.

If baking is required, refer to IPC/JEDEC J–STD–033 for bake procedure.

1. The embossment hole location shall be measured from the sprocket hole controlling the location of the embossment. Dimensions of embossment location and hole location shall be applied independent of each other.

2. The tape, with or without components, shall pass around R without damage (see Figure 4). 3. If S1 < 1.0 mm, there may not be enough area for cover tape to be properly applied (see EIA Standard 481–D, paragraph 4.3, section b). 4. B1 dimension is a reference dimension for tape feeder clearance only. 5. The cavity defi ned by A0, B0 and K0 shall surround the component with suﬃ cient clearance that:

(a) the component does not protrude above the top surface of the carrier tape. (b) the component can be removed from the cavity in a vertical direction without mechanical restriction, after the top cover tape has been removed. (c) rotation of the component is limited to 20° maximum for 8 and 12 mm tapes (see Figure 2). (d) lateral movement of the component is restricted to 0.5 mm maximum for 8 mm and 12 mm wide tape (see Figure 3). (e) see Addendum in EIA Standard 481–D for standards relating to more precise taping requirements.
