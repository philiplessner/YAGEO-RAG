TOKIN NeoCapacitor F/PS Low Profile High Capacitance Polymer Capacitor

KEMET a YAGEO company

Overview

NeoCapacitor® provides excellent performance for various applications due to high conductivity of the conductive polymer.

TOKIN’s devices are classified into the following three quality grades, in accordance with their application: Standard, Special, and Specific. The quality grade of all devices in this document is “standard” and cannot be used for “special” or “specific” quality grade applications. Customers who intend to use the products in this document for applications other than “standard” quality grade must contact KEMET sales representative in advance.

Standard: This quality grade is intended for applications in which failure or malfunction of the device is highly unlikely to cause harm to persons or damage to property, or be the source of any negative effects or problems in the wider community.

Special: This quality grade is intended for special applications that have common requirements, such specific industrial fields. Devices with a “special” quality grade are designed, manufactured, and tested using more a stringent quality assurance program than what is used for “standard” grade devices. There is a high possibility that failure or malfunction of the device when being used for applications in this category will cause harm to persons or damage to property, or bring negative effects or problems in the wider community.

Specific: Devices in this quality grade are designed, manufactured, and tested using a quality assurance program that is designated by the customer or that is created in accordance with the customer’s specifications. There is an extremely high possibility that failure or malfunction of the device when being used for applications in this category will cause harm to persons or damage to property, or bring serious problems in the wider community. Customers who use KEMET's products for these “specific” applications must conclude an individual quality agreement and/or development agreement with KEMET. A quality assurance program designated by the customer must also be determined in advance.

Benefits

Excellent noise absorption performance • Higher ripple current • Miniaturized, thinner, higher capacitance and lower ESR • Lead free (JEITA PHASE3), RoHS2 directive

(2011/65/EU + 2015/863/EU) and halogen-free.

• Antimony-free and Red phosphorous-free materials for mold resin.
