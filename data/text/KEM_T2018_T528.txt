KEMET Organic Capacitor (KO-CAP®) – Low ESR T528 Low ESL Polymer Electrolytic for CPU/GPU Decoupling

KEMET YAGEO

a YAGEO company

Overview

KO-CAP EIN

The KEMET Organic Capacitor (KO-CAP) is a solid electrolytic capacitor with a conductive polymer cathode capable of delivering very low ESR and improved capacitance retention at high frequencies. KO-CAP combines the low ESR of multilayer ceramic, the high capacitance of aluminum electrolytic, and the volumetric efficiency of tantalum into a single surface mount package. Unlike liquid electrolyte-based capacitors, KO-CAP has a very long operational life and high ripple current capabilities.

The T528 low ESL Facedown Terminal Polymer Electrolytic combines ultra-low ESR and high capacitance in a package design that offers the lowest ESL in the market. This series offers exceptional performance for high-speed microprocessor, FPGA, or ASIC decoupling designs. The T528 utilizes a unique termination design that allows for a reduction in the inductance loop area. This series offers improved capacitance retention at frequencies of up to 1 MHz.

Benefits

Low ESL < 0.7 nH at 20 MHz • Improved volumetric efficiency • High frequency capacitance retention • 100% accelerated steady state aging • 100% surge current tested • EIA standard case sizes • Lead free 260°C reflow capable

Reliability

KO-CAP capacitors have an average failure rate of 0.5 %/1,000 hours at category voltage, UC, and category temperature, TC. These capacitors are qualified using industry test standards at UC and TC. The minimum test time (1,000 or 2,000 hours) is dependent on the product.

The actual life expectancy of KO-CAP capacitors increases when application voltage, UA, and application temperature, TA, are lower than UC and TC. As a general guideline, when UA < 0.9 * UC and TA < 85°C, the life expectancy will typically exceed the useful lifetime of most hardware (> 10 years).

The lifetime of a KO-CAP capacitor at a specific application voltage and temperature can be modeled using the equations below. A failure is defined as passing enough current to blow a 1-Amp fuse. The calculation is an estimation based on empirical results and is not a guarantee.

VAF = ( )UC  UA  n  where:  VAF = acceleration factor due to voltage, unitless  UC = category voltage, volt UA = application voltage, volt n = exponent, 16 

TAF = e  [ (  Ea k  1  273+TA  1  273+TC  )]  where: TAF = acceleration factor due to temperature, unitless Ea = activation energy, 1.4 eV k = Boltzmann’s constant, 8.617E-5 eV/K TA = application temperature, °C TC = category temperature, °C

VR = Rated Voltage

Ripple Current/Ripple Voltage

Permissible AC ripple voltage and current are related to equivalent series resistance (ESR) and the power dissipation capabilities of the device. Permissible AC ripple voltage which may be applied is limited by two criteria: 1. The positive peak AC voltage plus the DC bias voltage,

if any, must not exceed the DC voltage rating of the capacitor.

2. The negative peak AC voltage in combination with bias voltage, if any, must not exceed the allowable limits specified for reverse voltage. See the Reverse Voltage section for allowable limits.

The maximum power dissipation by case size can be determined using the table at right. The maximum power dissipation rating stated in the table must be reduced with increasing environmental operating temperatures. Refer to the table below for temperature compensation requirements.

The maximum power dissipation rating must be reduced with increasing environmental operating temperatures. Refer to the Temperature Compensation Multiplier table for details.

Soldering Process

KEMET’s families of surface mount capacitors are compatible with wave (single or dual), convection, IR, or vapor phase reflow techniques. Preheating of these components is recommended to avoid extreme thermal stress. KEMET's recommended profile conditions for convection and IR reflow reflect the profile conditions of the IPC/J–STD–020D standard for moisture sensitivity testing. The devices can safely withstand a maximum of three reflow passes at these conditions.

Please note that although the X/7343–43 case size can withstand wave soldering, the tall profile (4.3 mm maximum) dictates care in wave process development.

Preheat/Soak Temperature Minimum (TSmin) Temperature Maximum (TSmax) Time (ts) from Tsmin to Tsmax) Ramp-up Rate (TL to TP) Liquidous Temperature (TL) Time Above Liquidous (tL)

Hand soldering should be performed with care due to the difficulty in process control. If performed, care should be taken to avoid contact of the soldering iron to the molded case. The iron should be used to heat the solder pad, applying solder between the pad and the termination, until reflow occurs. Once reflow occurs, the iron should be removed immediately. “Wiping” the edges of a chip and heating the top surface is not recommended.

Note: All temperatures refer to the center of the package, measured on the package body surface that is facing up during assembly reflow. * For Case Size height > 2.5 mm ** For Case Size height ≤ 2.5 mm

Storage

All KO-CAP series are shipped in moisture barrier bags (MBBs) with desiccant and humidity indicator card (HIC). These parts are classified as MSL3 (Moisture Sensitivity Level 3) per IPC/JEDEC J–STD–020 and packaged per IPC/JEDEC J–STD–033. MSL3 specifies a floor time of 168 H at 30°C maximum temperature and 60% relative humidity. Unused capacitors should be sealed in a MBB with fresh desiccant.

The calculated shelf life in a sealed bag would be 12 months from a bag seal date in a storage environment of < 40°C and humidity < 90% RH. It should be 24 months from a bag seal date in a storage environment of < 30°C and humidity < 70% RH.

If baking is required, refer to IPC/JEDEC J–STD–033 for bake procedure.

1. The embossment hole location shall be measured from the sprocket hole controlling the location of the embossment. Dimensions of embossment location and hole location shall be applied independent of each other.

2. The tape, with or without components, shall pass around R without damage (see Figure 4). 3. If S1 < 1.0 mm, there may not be enough area for cover tape to be properly applied (see EIA Standard 481–D, paragraph 4.3, section b). 4. B1 dimension is a reference dimension for tape feeder clearance only. 5. The cavity defi ned by A0, B0 and K0 shall surround the component with suﬃ cient clearance that:

(a) the component does not protrude above the top surface of the carrier tape. (b) the component can be removed from the cavity in a vertical direction without mechanical restriction, after the top cover tape has been removed. (c) rotation of the component is limited to 20° maximum for 8 and 12 mm tapes (see Figure 2). (d) lateral movement of the component is restricted to 0.5 mm maximum for 8 mm and 12 mm wide tape (see Figure 3). (e) see Addendum in EIA Standard 481–D for standards relating to more precise taping requirements.

Packaging Information Performance Notes

1. Cover tape break force: 1.0 kg minimum. 2. Cover tape peel strength: The total peel strength of the cover tape from the carrier tape shall be:

Tape Width Peel Strength 8 mm 0.1 to 1.0 newton (10 to 100 gf) 12 mm 0.1 to 1.3 newton (10 to 130 gf)

The direction of the pull shall be opposite the direction of the carrier tape travel. The pull angle of the carrier tape shall be 165° to 180° from the plane of the carrier tape. During peeling, the carrier and/or cover tape shall be pulled at a velocity of 300 ±10 mm/minute. 3. Labeling: Bar code labeling (standard or custom) shall be on the side of the reel opposite the sprocket holes. Refer to EIA Standards 556 and 624.
