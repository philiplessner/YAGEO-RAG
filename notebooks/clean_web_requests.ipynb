As far as I know there is possibility for such an event to occur when the crack on the housing allows the inlet of moisture and other alien particles. This might lead to an increased leakage current still it is not a clear short event. Current starts to flow between the terminals which might be in the nA-uA range. Can this lead to degradation of the dielectric material? Can the current be higher then? How fast this can happen? What factors the amount of current have? I would need to evaluate if such a failure mode occurs the current can be high enough to cause additional heat in the circuit and if this can be a stable - long-lasting - event.

       " \"Hello, I have a question about tantalum capacitors governed my MIL-PRF-39003. In MIL-PRF-39003, it states the following: 3.4.4 Pure tin. The use of pure tin, as an underplate or final finish, is prohibited both internally and externally. Tin content of capacitor components and solder shall not exceed 97 percent by mass. Tin shall be alloyed with a minimum of 3 percent lead, by mass (see 6.8). Lead-free, tin alloy high temperature solders may be used where high temperature solder is necessary with approval of the qualifying activity. The tin content of lead-free high temperature solders shall not exceed 97 percent by mass. This requires at least 3% lead on all tin finishes. But this then conflicts with MIL-STD-1580 requirement 10.4 for DPA of these capacitors, which states the following: 10.4.1.2 Prohibited Materials Analysis. Prohibited materials analysis shall be performed according to Section 9 of this document. (1 sample) Note: for both internal and external PMA, Sn/Sb is used in the tubulet solder joint and is not a cause for rejection as long as < 97% Sn is noted. MIL-STD-1580 makes no mention of the pure tin requirement, and theoretically it would be possible to have less than 3% lead and still pass the 1580 requirement, even while failing the requirements of MIL-PRF-39003. Furthermore I cannot find any reference on the Kemet datasheet to this Sn/Sb alloy. Can you confirm the material construction of the tubelet for capacitors of the MIL-PRF-39003/10 type? Also would it be possible to have the tublet solder joint be less than 3% lead AND less than 97% tin, due to the Sn/Sb alloy- and if so, wouldn't this not meet the requirements of 39003?\",\n",

       " \"I am looking into thermal management for one of your products -- Miniature Signal Relays EC2/EE2. I have a few questions about ambient/operational temperature(s). First -- I see that the operational temperature range is listed at -40 to 85 deg C, but is really only valid up to 60 deg C at higher humidities. Am I interpretting the datasheet correctly in regards to this? Second -- I am assuming that the majority of the heat will dissipate out the case/package of the relay, & I don't need to worry about any internal temperature rise so long as I keep the ambient temperature around these relays below 85 deg C (or 60 deg C with humid air). So long as my airflow intake temperature plus fluid temperature rise is below this mark, I shouldn't run into any issues, correct? Thanks.\",\n",

       " \"Hi, I am looking for some technical support regarding understanding the RMS current ratings for the R60 film capacitor series. In particular, how can you extrapolate from the chart what the current level of a capacitor would be with higher capacitance but the same lead pitch as what's given in the chart (cf. Maximum Current vs. Frequency for 160Vdc / 90Vac)?  I am interested to purchase the R60GR5680AA00M which has 68uF capacitance with a 27.5mm lead spacing. However, it is critical to my design to know whether it can handle a larger RMS current at 120Hz than what is shown in the graph (6.8uF, 27.5mm lead spacing).  My understanding is from a thermal perspective. Thus, if the capacitance is 68uF, the equivalent resistance at 120Hz is 1/10 of that for a 6.8uF capacitor. Hence, should the 68uF capacitor be able to process 10 times the current shown in the plot? Please let me if you have any trouble understanding my question, or would like to discuss further.

I have completed my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. Pitamber Mahanandia (associate professor), Department of Physics and Astronomy, NIT Rourkela, Odisha, India. As a candidate, I have rich experience in the field of supercapacitors, I am highly skilled in the synthesis, electrode fabrication and device fabrication of carbon materials such as graphene (Single and few layers), carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs, MWCNTs), porous activated carbon from various carbon sources, and numerous metal oxides (ZnFe2O4, V2O5, MnO2, Ni(OH)2 etc.) for supercapacitor applications. I also have good experience with various synthesis techniques such as simple pyrolysis method, electrochemical exfoliation method, CVD, sol-gel, hydrothermal and solvothermal methods. I have spent the last five years working on a supercapacitor and dedicatedly studied the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. I have designed a ZnFe2O4 and carbon-based novel hybrid supercapacitor device with excellent electrochemical properties (Tested using a RED LED Light, charged in 12 seconds, and lasted for 2 minutes). The newly designed ZnFe2O4@MWCNTs/AC supercapacitor device resulted in a maximum energy density of 17 Wh/kg with a power density of 6000 W/kg. The device demonstrated excellent capacitance retention of 97% over 10,000 cycles. I have very good publications in reputed journals and a total of 18 publications I have.

Today I pulled out a RIFA PME 265 MB 510 and it has cracks all over it. Many people report those to explode, which I also experienced. Not only that you get surprised, it also often disables the computer from working until it is removed/replaced and it has a chemical smell and smoke and residue.  I am really disappointed in the product, this should not happen. You can read all over the internet troubles with the RIFA capacitor and all over youtube people are worried about their computers. Some may even get thrown away because of your product.  What a irony to make a \"safety\" capacitor that explodes... The computer is fine just your capacitor is not. Does not serve any purpose except worrying people and bringing electronics to the landfill.  I hope you improve the product, that is unresponsible. Do you not even test the product before you sell it to people? I am very disappointed, and probably you do not use the RIFA brand any longer, with such a bad reputation, no wonder that it is gone from the market.

SPS exhibits excellent electrical properties and heat resistance, making it an ideal material for film capacitors. With a crystalline melting temperature of 270°C, SPS offers significantly higher heat resistance compared to polypropylene. By utilizing SPS, further improvement in heat resistance can be achieved. Additionally, SPS can be successfully processed into thin films at the level of 3μm using biaxial stretching methods. We also have a proven track record in deposition processes using SPS. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to introduce SPS to your development team and discuss the potential benefits it can bring to your products.

I think tantalum scraps are generated from each process while they are being manufactured. In the form of powder, anode, wire pin, etc... We handle minor metals such as Ta, W, Mo, Ti, Zr and their alloys. Regarding Ta materials, about 20 tons per year are exported abroad. They are mainly high-purity turning, and there are also forms of spent targets, cut sheets, etc. Ta capacitor scraps are often brought in.

Since this January I am getting very low wan speed between the main PL and the one in the office (about 238mbps). I was told that this is due to line interference. both by tplink and my electrician.

In PPC, you may get the sales but only after paying a certain amount every time and if you stop paying, then the sales will vanish?soon. ?. In SEO, You need to spend a budget for a few months. Once keywords will be on the first page of Google, you can get satisfied traffic for a long time. . 90% of users like Organic results over the sponsored ones because these results are more relevant and valuable. So just imagine how many valuable customers you are losing by not focusing on organic search results.

We'll show you TOP Rankings in your keywords, link popularity, organic traffic, and many more... After reviewing your website. I noticed some major on-page and off-page issues need to be fixed soon.

       " \"Hi! I'm Benjamin Weber, a 17-year-old high school student looking for job opportunities in the electrical engineering/computer science fields. Currently, I work at Chick-fil-a as a manager, but I'm looking for something closer to what my major will be in college(computer science). I'm reaching out in search of a possible part-time job with Kemet, as I live really close. I'd be able to work 5 days a week besides Thursdays due to my school extra-curricular. As a side note, I'm primarily working to support my mother and pay for my car/insurance, so I can't do an unpaid internship(this sounds really stingy and I apologize). If there's any more information you need please email me back!  Thanks for your consideration, Benjamin Weber\",\n",
